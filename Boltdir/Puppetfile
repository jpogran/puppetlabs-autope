# External non-Puppet content
#
# Not a perfect solution given some assumptions made by r10k about repository
# naming, specifically that there can only be one "-" or "/" in the name and
# the component preceding those characters is dropped. These assumptions make
# using content from other tool that follow a different naming pattern
# sub-optimal but ultimately the on disk name and the name of the source
# repository are not required to match and naming is irrelevant to Bolt when the
# content is outside the modules and site-modules directories.
